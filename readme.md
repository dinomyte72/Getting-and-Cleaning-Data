# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
This repository hosts the course project files (R code and documentation files) for the Coursera Data Science's Specialization course "Getting and Cleaning data".

The dataset for this project can be found at the following link: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

###Files

The code assumes that all pertinent data files are present in the same folder.

A codebook, named *CodeBook.md*, describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

The R code used for this analysis is found in the *run_analysis.R* file.

The output of the analysis is saved in the file called *averages_data.txt*.
